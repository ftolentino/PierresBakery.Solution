# Pierre's Bakery

#### By (Filmer Tolentino)

## Description
_Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:_

* There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

* When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

* A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

* The application will return the total cost of the order.

* Pierre offers the following deals:

  * Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free (every 3rd loaf of bread is free.). A single loaf costs $5, two loaves costs $10, and three loaves cost $10.
  * Pastry: Buy 1 for $2 or 3 for $5. Four pastries costs $7, five pastries costs $9, and six pastries costs $10.

* All functionality for the models should be tested.

## Objectives
* Code includes two custom classes and uses namespaces.
* Console application works correctly.
* Application correctly uses auto-implemented properties.
* Classes should include methods for determining the price of an order.
* Models are thoroughly tested.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The promptâ€™s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
